Digital SAT Question Generation Prompt
Context and Objective
You are an expert Digital SAT question creator tasked with generating high-quality practice questions for the question subcategory: 'Linear equations in two variables''. You will be provided with a PDF file containing many sample questions from this subcategory, along with detailed explanations. Your goal is to analyze these samples thoroughly and create 30 new questions (10 easy, 10 medium, 10 hard) that maintain the same quality and testing standards while being completely original.

Analysis Phase Instructions
Sample Question Analysis
Carefully examine the provided PDF file and analyze:
Content Analysis:
What specific skills, concepts, and knowledge areas are being tested
Common question patterns, formats, and structures
Types of distractors (incorrect answer choices) used
How questions test different cognitive levels (recall, application, analysis, synthesis)
Subject-specific terminology and language patterns
Visual elements such as graphs, charts, or diagrams and how they integrate with question content

Difficulty Level Analysis:
Easy Questions: Identify characteristics that make questions accessible (direct application, familiar contexts, straightforward language, minimal steps)
Medium Questions: Note features that add complexity (multi-step reasoning, less familiar contexts, integration of concepts)
Hard Questions: Analyze what makes questions challenging (complex reasoning, abstract concepts, multiple integrated skills, sophisticated analysis)

Quality Standards:
Clarity and precision of question stems
Effectiveness of answer choices (one clearly correct, plausible distractors)
Appropriateness of explanations
Alignment with Digital SAT format and standards
Clear integration of visual elements when present

Pattern Recognition
Identify recurring elements:
Question stem structures and formats
Common mathematical or linguistic constructs
Typical contexts and scenarios used
Standard explanation formats and reasoning patterns
Use of graphs, charts, or visual aids in questions

Generation Requirements
Format Specifications
Generate exactly 30 questions in the following JSON format:
[
{
"text": "Question text here",
"graphDescription": null,
"options": [
"Option A",
"Option B", 
"Option C",
"Option D"
],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"difficulty": "easy",
"explanation": [
"Step 1: Explain the first step of solving the problem.",
"Step 2: Show the calculation or next logical step.",
"Step 3: State the final answer and why it's correct.",
"Option A is incorrect because [specific reason].",
"Option C is incorrect because [specific reason].",
"Option D is incorrect because [specific reason]."
],
"subcategory": "Linear equations in two variables"
}
]

Example with graph description (only when a visual element is actually needed):
{
"text": "Based on the graph described below, what is the slope of the line?",
"graphDescription": "A coordinate plane showing a straight line passing through points (0, 2) and (4, 6). The x-axis ranges from -2 to 6, and the y-axis ranges from 0 to 8.",
"options": ["1", "2", "1/2", "4"],
"correctAnswer": 0,
"difficulty": "medium",
"explanation": [
"Step 1: Identify two points from the graph description: (0, 2) and (4, 6).",
"Step 2: Apply the slope formula: m = (y2 - y1) / (x2 - x1) = (6 - 2) / (4 - 0) = 4/4 = 1.",
"Step 3: The slope is 1.",
"Option B is incorrect because 2 would be too steep for this line.",
"Option C is incorrect because 1/2 would be too shallow.",
"Option D is incorrect because 4 is the rise, not the slope."
],
"subcategory": "Linear equations in two variables"
}

Graph Description Guidelines:
IMPORTANT: Most questions should NOT have graphs. Only include a graph when it's essential for testing the specific mathematical concept.

For questions WITHOUT visual elements (the majority):
- Set "graphDescription" to null
- Do not reference any visual elements in the question text

For questions WITH visual elements (only when necessary):
- Provide a detailed description in the "graphDescription" field
- Include all relevant details: axis labels, scales, plotted points, lines, intersections, and any other visual information needed to solve the problem
- Describe the visual elements clearly enough that someone could understand and work with the graph without seeing it
- The question text should reference the graph appropriately (e.g., "Based on the graph described below...")
- Ensure the graph is mathematically accurate and enhances the question rather than complicating it unnecessarily

Explanation Array Guidelines:
Break explanations into logical steps (typically 3-6 array elements)
First elements: Step-by-step solution process
When graphs are involved, reference the visual elements described in the graphDescription field
Last elements: Why each incorrect option is wrong
Each array element: One complete thought or step (1-2 sentences max)
No special escaping needed - each array element is a simple string
Clear and concise: Each step should be easily understood

Content Requirements
Question Distribution:
10 Easy questions (difficulty: "easy")
10 Medium questions (difficulty: "medium") 
10 Hard questions (difficulty: "hard")

Visual Element Integration:
IMPORTANT: Only a small minority of questions should include visual elements. Most questions should be text-only.

Guidelines for visual elements:
- Only include graphs when they are essential for testing the mathematical concept (e.g., interpreting slope from a graph, finding intercepts visually)
- Do NOT add graphs to questions that can be solved algebraically without visual aids
- When visual elements are included, ensure the graph description is comprehensive and accurate
- Visual elements should enhance the question and test relevant mathematical concepts, not add unnecessary complexity
- Graphs should be appropriate for the subcategory and difficulty level
- Aim for roughly 20-25 questions without graphs and 5-10 questions with graphs in your set of 30

Quality Standards:
Originality: Questions must be completely original with no shared context, scenarios, or specific details from sample questions
Authenticity: Maintain the authentic Digital SAT style, format, and rigor
Accuracy: All questions must have exactly one correct answer with mathematically/linguistically sound reasoning
Clarity: Question stems should be clear, unambiguous, and appropriately challenging for the target difficulty
Effective Distractors: Incorrect options should be plausible and represent common misconceptions or errors
Visual Clarity: When graphs are included, descriptions must be precise and complete

Answer Choice Guidelines:
Exactly 4 options (A, B, C, D) for each question
One clearly correct answer
Three plausible but incorrect distractors
Avoid "all of the above" or "none of the above" options
Ensure distractors test understanding rather than just guessing

Explanation Requirements:
First array elements: Step-by-step solution showing how to get the correct answer
Include relevant concepts, formulas, or reasoning steps
When graphs are present, reference specific visual elements from the graph description
Last array elements: Brief explanation of why each incorrect option is wrong
Use clear, educational language appropriate for students
Keep each step concise and focused

Difficulty Calibration
Easy Questions:
Test fundamental concepts and basic applications
Require 1-2 steps of reasoning
Use familiar contexts and straightforward language
Focus on direct recall or simple application of rules
Simple graphs with clear, obvious features if visual elements are used

Medium Questions:
Require multi-step reasoning or integration of concepts
May involve less familiar contexts or scenarios
Test deeper understanding beyond basic recall
Require analysis or synthesis of information
More complex graphs requiring interpretation if visual elements are used

Hard Questions:
Involve complex, multi-layered reasoning
Test sophisticated understanding and application
May require creative problem-solving approaches
Integrate multiple concepts or skills simultaneously
Sophisticated graphs requiring advanced interpretation if visual elements are used

Technical Specifications
Field Requirements:
text: The complete question stem
graphDescription: null for most questions; detailed description (string) only when a visual element is essential
