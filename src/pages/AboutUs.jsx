          <h2>Our Mission</h2>
          <p>
            At UltraSATPrep, we believe every student deserves access to high-quality, personalized SAT preparation. 
            Our mission is to democratize test prep by providing adaptive, AI-powered learning experiences that 
            help students achieve their highest potential on the SAT exam.

          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded by educators and technologists who understand the challenges students face in standardized 
            test preparation, UltraSATPrep was born from a simple belief: test prep should be engaging, 
            effective, and accessible to everyone.
          </p>
          <p>
            We recognized that traditional test prep methods often fail to address individual learning styles 
            and pace. That's why we built UltraSATPrep as an adaptive learning platform that personalizes the 
            study experience for each student, ensuring they focus on areas where they need the most improvement.
